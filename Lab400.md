### Step 1: Setting Up Facebook Messenger
Start off by generating the App Secret and the Page Access token in Facebook Messenger.
1. Log into your Facebook developer’s account.

2. Create a Facebook page that hosts your bot. The description, images, and cover page you add to the page will identify your bot to its users.

3. Next, create the Facebook app that you’ll link to this page. Because this is a Messenger app, choose Apps for Messenger and then click Create App ID.

Once you create the app, you will see the App ID on the top of your screen.

Now click on the settings on the top left side pane and get the App Secret which is required to integrate with your UniversityWorkshop bot.

Once you added the messenger product, goto settings and scroll down until you find the Token Generation Card.
Select a facebook page which you have already created for the University of Illinois and copy the page access token which is generated dynamically.
