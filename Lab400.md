# Lab 400: Create Web Channel & Interact with Chatbot on Website
## Introduction
In this lab, we will learn about channels and make the chatbot available through the University site.

## Objectives
- Congfigure web channel for bot
- Configuring the Static Website with Chatbot SDK

- You should have completed Lab 100 of this workshop.
- You should have completed Lab 200 of this workshop.
- You may have completed Lab 300 of this workshop.

### Step 1: Add a Web Channel for website
Bots arenâ€™t apps that you download from an app marketplace. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, a custom mobile app, or in our case, a website. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single bot can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously.

- Navigate to UniversityWorkshop bot and click on Settings icon on the left side panel and **Channels** tab.

- As you can see, by default, it has System_Bot_Test channel that is used on this dashboard where you did testing using the play button. 
- Click on **+ Channel** to add a new channel.

![](./images/400/2.png)

- Enter the following information in the prompt:
    - Name: `Web` for example
    - Description: `Web channel for University of Illinois` for example
    - Channel Type: `Web`
    - Turn on **Channel Enabled**
- Click on **Create**

- Now you should see a web channel created. You should have your own App Id (hidden in the picture for security purposes) that we will use later.

### Step 2: Configuring the Static Website with Chatbot SDK

- Once the channel is configured in the chatbot, select the **UniversityWebsite.zip** from the files you cloned from git.
- In order to configure the chatbot on a webpage, you must use the Client SDK **http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/downloads/amce-downloads-4478270.html** for Javascript in your static html file.
- To make this workshop easier, the Client SDK is deployed in Oracle Cloud Storage **https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/gse00014632/b/AMCEbotSDK/o**

- Open up the **index.html** file from **UniversityWebsite** folder, copy and paste the code below under **Beginning of University Bot init script.**


**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**

'''
    <script>
      !function(e,t,n,r){
        function s(){
         try{
           var e;
            if((e="string"==typeof this.response?JSON.parse(this.response):this.response).url){
            var n=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],r=t.createElement("script");
            r.async=!0,r.src=e.url,n.parentNode.insertBefore(r,n)
          }
         }
         catch(e){}}var o,p,a,i=[],c=[];e[n]={init:function(){o=arguments;
          var e={then:function(t){
            return c.push({type:"t",next:t}),e
            } ,catch:function(t){return c.push({type:"c",next:t}),e}};
            return e},on:function(){
             i.push(arguments)},render:function(){p=arguments},destroy:function(){a=arguments}
            } ,e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__=function(t){
             if(delete e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__,e[n]=t,o)for(var r=t.init.apply(t,o),s=0;s<c.length;s++){
              var u=c[s];
               r="t"===u.type?r.then(u.next):r.catch(u.next)
               } p&&t.render.apply(t,p),a&&t.destroy.apply(t,a);
             for(s=0;s<i.length;s++)t.on.apply(t,i[s])};
             var u=new XMLHttpRequest;u.addEventListener("load",s),u.open("GET",r+"/loader.json",!0),u.responseType="json",u.send()
            }
         (window,document,"Bots", "https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/gse00014632/b/AMCEbotSDK/o");
    </script>
'''

- Copy and paste the below code under **Beginning of bots Init Script**

**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**

'''

    <script>
      Bots.init({
        appId: '<your app-id>',
        businessName: 'Gen University',
        businessIconUrl: 'images/univlogo-120.png',
        displayStyle: "button",
        buttonIconUrl: 'images/discuss-issue-5.png',
        buttonWidth: '90',
        buttonHeight: '90',
        customColors: {
          brandColor: '000',
          conversationColor: '000',
          actionColor: 'ced92e'
        },
        customText: {
          headerText: 'How can I help you?',
          introductionText: 'We are here to help, so ask us anything!'
        }
      });
    </script>

'''

- In the above script, make sure to replace the **App-ID** with your app-id copied from creating the channel.
- Zip up the contents in the folder and rename it as **genUniversityWebsite.zip**

### Step 3: Deploying the static website in Oracle Application Container Cloud
- Open up a browser and navigate to: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in 
- Sign in using the credentials you used to create the free trail account.
- Now, you are in the Oracle Cloud dashboard. Click on the hamburger menu button on the upper left of the screen and expand **Services.**

![](./images/400/10.png)

- Scroll down and find **Application Container** and click on it.

![](./images/400/11.png)

- It will take you to the welcome screen of Application Container and now click on **Go to Console** button

![](./images/400/12.png)

- Now to deploy the static website, click on the **Create Application**

![](./images/400/13.png)

- You will be provided with a bunch of different application types. Select **Node**

![](./images/400/14.png)

- Provide an appropriate Name for your service and upload the zip file for application.

![](./images/400/15.png)

![](./images/400/16.png)

- Once the zip file is uploaded, change the instances to **1** and then click **Create**

![](./images/400/17.png)

- Once application is created (may take upto **20 minutes**), you will be able to find a link using which you can interact with your bot.

![](./images/400/18.png)

### Step 4: Interact with UniversityWorkshop Bot on Website
- Open up a browser and navigate to the link which your service provided in the last step.
- This is a website we have created for our generic university. Take a glance at the website. 

![](./images/400/19.png)

- Click on **Chat Head Icon** button and it will pop-up a chat window where you can get information about the university.

![](./images/400/20.png)

- You can test out the chatbot by engaging with a simple conversation.
