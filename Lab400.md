# Lab 400: Create Channel and Interact with Chatbot on Website
## Introduction
In this lab, we will learn about channels and make the chatbot available through the University site.

## Objectives
- Clear understanding of channels
- Integrating chatbot with website.

## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.
- You should have completed Lab 100 of this workshop.
- You should have completed Lab 200 of this workshop.

### Step 1: Add a Channel for website
Bots aren’t apps that you download from an app marketplace. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, a custom mobile app, or in our case, a website. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single bot can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously.

- Navigate to UniversityWorkshop bot and click on Settings icon and **Channel**

- As you can see, by default, it has System_Bot_Test channel that is used on this dashboard where you did testing using the play button. 
- Click on **+ Channel** to add a new channel.

- Enter the following information in the prompt:
    - Name: `Web`
    - Description: `Web channel for University of Illinois`
    - Channel Type: `Web`
    - Turn on **Channel Enabled**
- Click on **Create**

- Now you should see a web channel created. You should have your own App Id (hidden in the picture for security purposes) that we will use later.

### Step 2: Configuring the Website with Chatbot SDK
- The Intelligent Bots Client SDK for JavaScript module is a highly customizable messaging widget that can be added to any web page.
    - Configuring Library
    - Deploying SDK Files
    - Adding the Client SDK for JavaScript to your Site
- The Intelligent Bots library is composed of multiple assets that get fetched at runtime for better performance. For that reason, the public path (the URL where the static files are hosted) is hardcoded in multiple places.

**Configuring Library**
- To configure the library for your environment, run:
    - ./configure 
- The script generates a folder with the configured project in it.
- If the static files are hosted at http://localhost:8000/static/ and you run the following script from the /home/your-name/ folder:
    - ./configure http://localhost:8000/static/
then the files will be available at /home/your-name/http:__localhost:8000_static_/.
Production Setup
- If the static files are hosted at https://cdn.acme.org/ and you run the following script from the /home/your-name/ folder:
    -   ./configure https://cdn.acme.org/
- then the files will be available at /home/your-name/https:__cdn.acme.org_/.

**Deploying the SDK Files**
- Download the Client SDK for JavaScript 18.2.3.0 module from the Oracle Technology Network’s <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/downloads/amce-downloads-4478270.html">Oracle Autonomous Mobile Cloud Enterprise download page.</a>
    - Put all of the files from the generated folder at the root of the storage within https://placeholder.public.path/. For example if your files are hosted at http://localhost:8000/static/, copy all the files to the static folder on your local server.
    - If your storage is behind a CDN (Content Delivery Network), issue a cache invalidation for https://placeholder.public.path/loader.json.
    - Make sure your server allows CORS requests.
    - Test your deployment by initializing the SDK as described in Adding the Client SDK for JavaScript to Your Site.

**Adding the Client SDK for JavaScript to your Site**
- Step 1: Include the Client SDK for JavaScript in Your Web Page
    - Add the following code towards the end of the head section on your page and replace <sdk-folder-url> with the URL where the SDK is hosted.

- Step 2: Initialize the Client SDK for JavaScript with Your New App ID
    - Next, initialize the SDK by adding the following snippet near the end of the body section of your page. and replace **app-id** with your App Id for the Web channel found in your app settings page.

### Step 3: Interact with UniversityWorkshop Bot on Website
- Open up a browser and navigate to: https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/gse00014632/b/GenUniversityBotSampleSite/o/index.html
- This is a website we have created for our generic university. Take a glance at the website. 

![](./images/400/7.png)

- Click on **Chat Head Icon** button and it will pop-up a chat window where you can get information about the university.

- You can test out the chat-bot by engaging with a simple conversation.
