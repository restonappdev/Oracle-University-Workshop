### Step 1: Setting Up Facebook Messenger
Start off by generating the App Secret and the Page Access token in Facebook Messenger.
    Markup: *Log into your Facebook developer’s account.

    *Create a Facebook page that hosts your bot. The description, images, and cover page you add to the page will identify your bot to its users.

    *Next, create the Facebook app that you’ll link to this page. Because this is a Messenger app, choose Apps for Messenger and then click Create App ID.

### Step 1: Add a Channel for website
Bots aren’t apps that you download from an app marketplace. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, a custom mobile app, or in our case, a website. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single bot can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously.

- Navigate to UniversityWorkshop bot and click on Settings icon and **Channel**

- As you can see, by default, it has System_Bot_Test channel that is used on this dashboard where you did testing using the play button. 
- Click on **+ Channel** to add a new channel.

- Enter the following information in the prompt:
    - Name: `Facebook`
    - Description: `Facebook channel for University of Illinois`
    - Channel Type: `Facebook Messenger`
    - Turn on **Channel Enabled**
- Click on **Create**

- Now you should see a web channel created. You should have your own App Id (hidden in the picture for security purposes) that we will use later.

### Step 2: Interact with UniversityWorkshop Bot on Website
- Open up a browser and navigate to: **University of Illinois Website**
- This is a website we have created for our generic university. Take a glance at the website. 

**Insert University Website**

- Click on **Chat** button and enter in your App Id you received from creating a web channel.

**Insert University Website**

- A chat window should automatically pop up on the side. Now, you can order pizza here! Go ahead and talk to it!

**Insert University Website with Chatbot**

- In a real-world situation, instead of entering an App Id, you would have it somewhere in the web app and have the chat ready whenever a user gets into the website. 




- This concludes our chatbot workshop. The materials in this workshop is just the tip of the iceberg of Intelligent Bot and AMCe's capabilities. Here is the documentation for AMCe if you are interested in learning more: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/mobile-autonomous-cloud/index.html. We look forward to seeing what you can build with AMCe!
