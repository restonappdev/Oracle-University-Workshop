Student service will allow you to get or update students basic information (such as: phone, email, address etc.); Visitor service will provide you FAQ answers on the basic of your asked questions.

- Now, you have familiarized with the dashboard, imported a chatbot, and interacted with a chatbot. The bot is interactive but we would like to add more functionalities to it. Let's do that in the next lab!
