- Here we have the dashboard for all of your chatbots. We are going to import a basic pizza ordering chatbot. We will improve this chatbot's interaction in later labs. Click on **Import Bot** on the top right of the screen and select the **Nom_Nom_Pizza_Bot.zip** from the files you cloned from git.

- On this page is where you will develop the content, interaction, and channels for the bot. We will dive into each section on the next lab. To test the functionality and the flow of the current bot, click on the Play button on the top right of the screen. This will open up a testing place to test the functionality of your chatbot before you fully commit to it.

- Go ahead and chat with the bot. You can say "order pizza".

- As you can see, it will reply with pizzas you might like. Select one you would like to order, select a size, and then send your location so the restaurant knows where to deliver to. Now, Nom Nom Pizza has your order and will be delivered in 120 seconds!

- Now, you have familiarized with the dashboard, imported a chatbot, and interacted with a chatbot. The bot is interactive but we would like to add more functionalities to it. Let's do that in the next lab!
