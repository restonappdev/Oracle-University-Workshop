# Lab 200: Enhance Nom Nom Pizza Bot
## Introduction
This lab will dive into the details of development of the bot. We will be adding a new intent for checking order status, an instant app that serves as customer survey, and lastly a custom component which integrates the location information with the Google Places API. This will make Nom Nom Pizza bot more interactive.
## Objectives
- Add a new intent to Nom Nom Pizza bot
- Add an instant app of a customer survey to the bot interaction
- Add custom component for location
## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.
- You should have completed Lab 100 of this workshop.

---
### Step 1: Add Checking Last Order Status Intent
- Navigate to Nom Nom Pizza Bot that you have imported on lab 100.

![](./images/200/1.png)

- On the first screen, you can define intents for your chatbot. Intents illustrate your use case by describing the various actions that your bot helps its users complete.
- There are 3 intents that came with the import file: OrderPasta, OrderPizza, and ShowMenu. Under each intent tab, there are utterances which are the sample phrases or sentences that you expect the user to say for that specific intent so that your bot will match those phrases to the intent. 

![](./images/200/2.png)

- Right now, after you order a pizza, there is no way for customer to check their order status through the bot. We would like to add that so that the customer can easily check their order status. Let's first add a new intent by clicking on **+ Intent**. 
- Enter the following information for this intent
    - Name: `OrderStatus` (It has to be this exact phrase for the rest of the lab.)
    - Description: For customers to check their order status.

![](./images/200/3.png)

- Now, we would like to add some utterances that you would expect chatbot users to say when they want to check their order status. To add them, enter in phrases or sentences in the input box and hit the ENTER key. 

![](./images/200/4.png)

- I have added a few utterances:
    - I want to check on my order
    - Order status
    - Where is my order?
    - Where is my pizza?
- To check if the intent you added is working, you can again use the built-in testing screen, and then click on Intent tab. Type in "I'd like to check where my pizza is" and send. 

![](./images/200/5.png)

- As you can see, even though the utterances do not include "I'd like to check where my pizza is", the built-in natural language processing engine is able to confidently match your sentence to the correct intent. You can also click on **Add Example** to add this sentence as part of your utterances for this intent.
- In addition to manually adding utterances, you can add them in batch by clicking on **Batch** and **Load** to load a csv of utterances. We won't do that in this example.

### Step 2: Add Check Order Flow

- Now, let's navigate to the dialog flow editor of this chatbot by clicking on the third button on the left.

![](./images/200/7.png)

- The dialog flow describes how your bot responds and behaves according to user input. It is written in YAML. From top to bottom of this YAML, it first defines some metadata about this bot. Then it defines a list of variables and default transitions that will be used. States are the majority of the dialog flow where it defines each state of the flow and the functions of them.
- To utilize our newly added intent, let's first scroll down to line 67. This is where the flow will try to interpret the user's intention and match it to the correct flow. 
- It is using `System.Intent` component to do so, and a confidence threshold of 50%. Components provide your bot with various functions so that it can respond to users. These can be generic functions like outputting text, or they can return information from a backend and perform custom logic.
- Now, on line 78, let's add a new action for our OrderStatus intent. `OrderStatus: "checkLastOrder"`   
- Make sure the intentation of this line matches the lines above. The final code for **Intent** state is like this:   

```
  Intent:
    component: "System.Intent"
    properties:
      confidenceThreshold: 0.5
      variable: "iresult"
    transitions:
      actions:
        unresolvedIntent: "Unresolved"
        OrderPasta: "OrderPasta"
        ShowMenu: "ShowMenu"
        OrderPizza: "OrderPizza"
        OrderStatus: "checkLastOrder"
```
- This means that if the intent matches to OrderStatus, it will go to the `checkLastOrder` state. However, that state hasn't been created yet. Let's add it now. Scroll down to line 265 and copy and paste this piece of YAML into it. We will go through this code.   

**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**
```
  checkLastOrder:
    component: "System.ConditionExists"
    properties:
      variable: "user.orderTime"
    transitions:
      actions:
        exists: "setRemainingTime"
        notexists: "noOrder"
  setRemainingTime:
    component: "System.SetVariable"
    properties:
      variable: "timeRemaining"
      value: "${((120000-(.now?long-user.orderTime?number))/1000)?floor}"
    transitions: {}
  orderStatus:
    component: "System.Switch"
    properties:
      source: "<#if (timeRemaining?number >= 100)>1<#elseif (timeRemaining?number < 100 && timeRemaining?number >= 80)>2<#elseif (timeRemaining?number < 80 && timeRemaining?number >= 60)>3<#elseif (timeRemaining?number < 60 && timeRemaining?number >= 40)>4<#elseif (timeRemaining?number < 40 && timeRemaining?number > 0)>5<#elseif (timeRemaining?number >= 0)>6</#if>"
      values:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
    transitions:
      actions:
        1: "orderStatusReceived"
        2: "orderStatusPrep"
        3: "orderStatusBake"
        4: "orderStatusBox"
        5: "orderStatusDelivery"
        6: "orderStatusDelivered"
  orderStatusReceived:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Your order #${user.orderTime?number%1000000} has been received. We will start making your delicious pizza shortly. It will be delivered in ${timeRemaining} seconds."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  orderStatusPrep:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "We are preping amazingly fresh ingredients for your order #${user.orderTime?number%1000000}. It will be delivered in ${timeRemaining} seconds."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  orderStatusBake:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Your pizza is in the oven! Mmm, it smells good! It will be delivered in ${timeRemaining} seconds."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  orderStatusBox:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Your order #${user.orderTime?number%1000000} is being boxed right now! Await amazingness! It will be delivered in ${timeRemaining} seconds."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  orderStatusDelivery:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Our fast and furious driver is delivering your order #${user.orderTime?number%1000000}. It will be delivered in ${timeRemaining} seconds."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  orderStatusDelivered:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Your order #${user.orderTime?number%1000000} has been delivered! Thank you for choosing Nom Nom Pizza! To place another order, say order pizza."
    transitions:
      return: "done"
  noOrder:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Sorry we can't find your order. Please make an order first!"
    transitions:
      return: "done"
```
- `checkLastOrder` uses `System.ConditionExists` to first check if a variable exists to determine if there is an order in the first place. Then, it transitions to `setRemainingTime` to calculate how much time there is remaining for the pizza to be delivered. In real world scenario, this would integrate with another system of the pizza restaurant that tracks the actual remaining time. For demo purpose, we will just allow 120 seconds from when the order is placed till delivery. 
- After that, it transitions to `orderStatus` which is using a `System.Switch` component to determine which stage the pizza is at for the remaining time. All the rest of the states are different responses the user will get based on the switch statement. 
- Now, click on **Validate** to make sure the flow doesn't have any error. If everything is correct, you should see something like below.

![](./images/200/8.png)

- Now, let's test our new flow. Click on the Play button again and start testing. First, order a pizza and finish the flow. Then, ask for your order status. You can ask for the order status multiple times to see status changes.

![](./images/200/9.png)

- You now have a chatbot that can check order status for you!

### Step 3: Add Customer Survey Instance App

- Natural language conversations are, by their very nature, free-flowing. But they may not always be the best way for your bot to collect information from its users. For example, some situations, like entering credit card or passport details, require users to enter specific information (and enter it precisely). To help your botâ€™s users enter this type of information easily, your bot can call an instant app, which provides forms with labels, options, choices, check boxes, data fields, and other UI elements.

- Click on **Instance Apps** next to Validate button on top right of the screen. (This is a pop-up that might be blocked by your browser; unblock it to continue.)

![](./images/200/10.png)

- This will take you to a dashboard for Instance Apps. Here, we will click on **New Instance App**. 

![](./images/200/11.png)

- As you can see, there are many templates you can choose from to help you build an instant app. For today, we will import a pre-built one. Click on **Import an Instance App** on the top left of the screen and drag and drop **Nom-Nom-Survey.json** from the folder you have cloned from github. 

![](./images/200/12.png)

- After you have done so, you should see a Nom Nom Survey created. If it says inactive, go ahead and activate it. 

![](./images/200/13.png)

- Click on Nom Nom Survey app and click on **Layout** tab. You should be able to see a preview of the app on the right side. This is what the app will look like. Let's leave it as is and go back to the flow editor of Nom_Nom_Pizza_Bot.

![](./images/200/14.png)

- Click on **Save** on upper right of the screen to close

### Step 4: Add an Interactive Component

- Nom Nom Pizza would like to ask for the customer's feedback after each order. So we would like to give out a survey to customer after they place an order. 
- To be able to use the instant app we just added, we need to add another state to our flow using `System.Interactive` component. 
- First, let's change state `Confirmation`'s transition. Scroll down to line 263, remove `return: "done"` and change to just `transitions: {}` so that it will just automatically flow to the next adjacent state. The final code snippet looks like this:   

**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**
```
  Confirmation:
    component: "System.CommonResponse"
    properties:
      metadata:
        responseItems:
        - text: "Thank you for your order! Your order number is ${orderTime?number%1000000}. Your ${pizzaSize} ${orderedPizza} pizza will be delivered in 120 seconds!"
          type: "text"
          name: "conf"
          separateBubbles: true
        - type: "attachment"
          attachmentType: "image"
          name: "image"
          attachmentUrl: "${orderedPizzaImage}"
      processUserMessage: false
      keepTurn: True
    transitions: {}
#Add survey state for instance app
  checkLastOrder:
    component: "System.ConditionExists"
    properties:
      variable: "user.orderTime"
    transitions:
      actions:
        exists: "setRemainingTime"
        notexists: "noOrder"
```
- Now on line 263 where it says `Add survey state for instance app`, replace that line of comment with this YAML code (make sure the indentations are correct):

**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**
```
  survey:
    component: "System.Interactive"
    properties:
      prompt: "We'd love to hear from you! Please tap the link to take a 10 sec customer survey!"
      sourceVariableList: ""
      variable: ""
      id: "nom_nom_survey"
    transitions:
      actions:
        cancel: "thank"
      next: "thank"
  thank:
    component: "System.Output"
    properties:
      text: "Thank you for your feedback!"
    transitions:
      return: "done"
```
- Let's take a quick look at this code snippet. `survey` state is using a built-in component to access instant app, being referenced by the property `id`. `prompt` property allows you specify a prompt to tell the user about this instant app. Since we are not passing any variables to instant app, `sourceVariableList` and `variable` are empty. Then, whether or not user fills out the survey or just cancel, it will flow to `thank` state.
- Now, validate the flow by clicking on **Validate** and a message will show if everything is correct. 

![](./images/200/15.png)

- You can again test the bot to see your instant app in action! Again, start a new order of pizza. You should see something like below.

![](./images/200/16.png)

- Click on the **Link** button to bring up the survey app. 

![](./images/200/17.png)

- Go ahead and give them a 5-star rating since they have a great chatbot! Click on **Submit** once you are done. Navigate back to the bot testing screen again and you should see a response thanking you. This is because after you click on Submit, the instant app posts back to the chat session you are on. 

![](./images/200/18.png)

- If you don't want to do the survey, you can always click on **Cancel**.

- Your chatbot now can provide a survey and collect feedback for you using an instant app!

### Step 5: Add A Service to Integrate with Other APIs

If your bot calls for a specific action thatâ€™s outside of the built-in components and functions, youâ€™ll need to use a custom component. Custom components let your bot call REST APIs that implement business logic and channel-specific rendering.

- For our chatbot, since we are already getting the user's location information, why not give them an option to choose which Nom Nom Pizza chain they would like to send the order to. We are going to leverage Google Places API to get the nearest Nom Nom Pizza restaurants.

- Navigate to Nom Nom Pizza Bot and click on custom component icon. Then, click on **+ Service**. 

![](./images/200/19.png)

- Enter the following information in the prompt:
  - Backend ID: `4f110195-40fd-4428-bfb4-ed5524d2898f`
  - Metadata URL: 
  `https://71280A530B234207B8024B6963E198C8.mobile.ocp.oraclecloud.com:443/mobile/custom/workshop_pizza_bot/components`
- Check **Use anonymous access**
  - Anonymous Key: 
  `NzEyODBBNTMwQjIzNDIwN0I4MDI0QjY5NjNFMTk4QzhfTW9iaWxlQW5vbnltb3VzX0FQUElEOmU1M2RmN2Y5LTU3ZmItNDc5OC04MDdhLWVmZDgyMjdmYTViNA==`
- Click on **Create**

![](./images/200/20.png)

- Now you should see a new service is added. 

![](./images/200/21.png)

- AMCe provides functionality to create web services and give you a central place to manage your mobile related backends. This is a backend web service that is already deployed in a separate AMCe instance. For this workshop, we are not going to spend time looking at AMCe's backend and API but if you are interested, the instructors would be happy to provide more details. Or you can contact us at tom.huang@oracle.com and nardos.megersa@oracle.com . 

- Click and expand **FindRestaurants**. This is one registered endpoint that chatbot can use to interact with. As you can see, it requires 3 properties, actionType, latitude, and longitude. They will be passed to the Google Places API to fetch data about Nom Nom Pizza locations. 

![](./images/200/22.png)

### Step 6: Utilize Custom Component

- Now, we have to add it into our flow. Go back to the dialog flow editor. First, we would like to change line 233 from `next: "setOrderTime"` to `next: "selectRestaurant"`. Be mindful about the indentation. 
- Then, let's add this state on line 234:


**When copying, please also include the leading white spaces and/or indentation on the first line to avoid any errors.**
```
  selectRestaurant: 
    component: "FindRestaurants"
    properties: 
      longitude: "${location.value.longitude}"
      latitude: "${location.value.latitude}"
      actionType: "select"
    transitions: {}
  confirmRestaurant: 
    component: "FindRestaurants"
    properties: 
      longitude: "${location.value.longitude}"
      latitude: "${location.value.latitude}"
      actionType: "confirm"
    transitions: {}
```
- As you can see, both `selectRestaurant` and `confirmRestaurant` use a component `FindRestaurants` which is what we defined using custom component service. They are also passing parameters of `longitude` and `latitude` that it will receive from `AskLocation`. 
- Validate the flow by clicking on **Validate**.

![](./images/200/23.png)

- Now, let's test it in the testing screen. Order a pizza, send your location, and see the Nom Nom Pizza restaurants near you!

![](./images/200/24.png)

- If you are interested in what the backend code looks like, there is a `custom-components.zip` file in the git folder you have cloned. You can look into it at your own pace. 

- Now, you have completed adding an order status intent, creating a customer survey using instant app, and integrating the chatbot with third party API by leveraging AMCe's backend and custom components. You are ready for the last lab where you interact with your chatbot in action on a web page.
