### Step 2: Training the Chat-bot and Editing the YAML
- Once the Q&A source is added, you should train the bot. Go-to the YAML page and click on **Train** at the top right corner.

- If the training is successful, you will see training success message.

- To use Q&A in a bot dialog flow, you need to configure the System.Qna component. You must also append a new transition to the System.Intent component that references this new component, so that Q&A questions are routed to the Q&A component.

- Goto the YAML page and modify the code to make the Q&A enabled in your chatbot.
- Enter **qna: "qna"** under the Intent section

- Replace the transitions code under pickOneService intent.

```
    transitions:
      actions:
        equal: "startQnAService"
        notequal: "startHCMService"

```

```
  startQnAService:
    component: "System.ResetVariables"
    properties:
      variableList: "iResult,isqna"
    transitions: {}
  askQnAService:
    component: "System.CommonResponse"
    properties:
      metadata:
        responseItems:
        - type: "text"
          text: "Welcome! Ask me a question. Example: What are the library hours?"
          name: "Sorry"
          separateBubbles: true
      processUserMessage: false
    transitions: {}
  qna:
    component: "System.QnA"
    properties:
      minimumMatch: "100%,100%"
      matchListLimit: 5
      enableCategoryDrilldown: false
      resultLayout: "vertical"
      exitLabel: "Exit Questions"
      keepTurn:
        next: true
        none: true
        exit: true
        textReceived: true 
    transitions:
      actions:
        none: "Unresolved"
      next: "confirmQnA"
  confirmQnA:
    component: "System.List"
    properties:
      options: "Yes,No"
      prompt: "Do you need more FAQ questions?"
      variable: "isqna"
    transitions: {}
  isQna:
    component: "System.ConditionEquals"
    properties:
      source: "${isqna}"
      value: "Yes"
    transitions:
      actions:
        equal: "startQnAService"
        notequal: "resetGetVariables"

```

### Step 3: Testing the Chat-bot for Q&A functionality
