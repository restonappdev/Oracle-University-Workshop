### Step 1: Add a Channel for website
Bots arenâ€™t apps that you download from an app marketplace. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, a custom mobile app, or in our case, a website. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single bot can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously.

- Navigate to UniversityWorkshop bot and click on Settings icon and **Channel**

- As you can see, by default, it has System_Bot_Test channel that is used on this dashboard where you did testing using the play button. 
- Click on **+ Channel** to add a new channel.

- Click on **Create**
